              <p>Developed a Lorcana TCG Library for Set 1: The First Chapter.<br><br>The main feature of this library is the filtering system, allowing users to search for cards by various categories such as Ink Color, Ink Cost, Keywords, and more. Upon searching, the library displays all relevant cards matching the user's criteria. Additionally, the library includes a Lore Counter feature, enabling players to track their scores and race to gain 20 points/lore. For those who wants more of an understanding of the game mechanics, a detailed Game Rules section is available.</p>

You can see the design slightly change to incorporate all puzzle levels. The user is to build upon each law and apply them to each "project" they are assigned. You are then rewarded with a Jibbit to add to your own personal croc.</p>
