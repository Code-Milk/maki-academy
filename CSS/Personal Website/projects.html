            <p>I envisioned my personal website as a virtual sketchbook not only to showcase my creative hobbies, but also underscore my proficiency in design, art, and the craftsmanship of coding it from scratch. My goal was to merge the realms of coding and artistry, crafting a digital experience that captivates with its blend of functionality and creativity.

                  <br><br>We originally started with 5 puzzles and later decided to do a puzzle for each Usability Law. You can see the design slightly change to incorporate all puzzle levels. The user is supposed to build upon each law and apply them to each "project" they are assigned. You are then rewarded with a Jibbit to add to your own personal croc.
